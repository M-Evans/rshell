# Observe what's in the current directory
ls -a

### in an expression containing '>' or '<', for the expression to
### be read as valid redirection, it musn't contain spaces.
### Those are the constraints under which I implemented this
### assignment.

## output redirection (>)
# creates a file
ls -a >afile
cat afile
# order doesn't matter
ls >afile -a
cat afile
>afile ls -a
cat afile
# take what would be printed on screen and put in file
cat afile >bfile
# overwrites a file
echo Hello world! >afile
cat afile
cat bfile
# failed command:
asdf >cfile
cat cfile
# some extra credit:
asdf 2>cfile
cat cfile



## input redirection
# use cat
cat <afile
cat <bfile
# it takes the first one
cat <afile <bfile


# overwrites and creates a file
ls -a
ls -a >afile
ls -a >>afile
# fails and goes to stderr:
ls -J
ls -J >>afile
ls -J 2>>afile
ls -J 2>>afile
# with afile
cat afile
# with infile
cat <infile
# control c:
grep batch <infile
# input redirection (<<<)
cat <<<"hello world!!! :D SO much text here. :)"
# input redirection (<)
cat 2<infile
