# Observe what's in the current directory
ls -a

### in an expression containing '>' or '<', for the expression to
### be read as valid redirection, it musn't contain spaces.
### Those are the constraints under which I implemented this
### assignment.

## output redirection (>)
# creates a file
ls -a >afile
cat afile && rm afile
# order doesn't matter
ls >afile -a
cat afile && rm afile
>afile ls -a
cat afile
# take what would be printed on screen and put in file
cat afile >bfile
# overwrites a file
echo Hello world! >afile
cat afile
cat bfile
# failed command:
asdf >cfile
cat cfile
# some extra credit:
asdf 2>cfile
cat cfile



## input redirection
# use cat
cat <afile
cat <bfile
# it takes the first one
cat <afile <bfile



# overwrites and creates a file
# overwrites and creates a file
